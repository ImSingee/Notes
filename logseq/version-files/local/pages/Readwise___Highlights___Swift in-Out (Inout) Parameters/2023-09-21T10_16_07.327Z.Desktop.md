- ou might wonder how Swift's in-out parameter **work behind the scene**.
  
  At first, I was thinking about something similar to **pass by reference**, but in-out parameter behavior is **simple than that**.
  
  Here is how it works.
  
  1.  When the function is called, **the value of the argument is copied**.
  2.  You **modify the copy** in the function body.
  3.  When the **function returns**, the copy's **value is assigned back to the original argument**.
  
  This behavior is known as **copy-in copy-out** or **call by value result**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01havjyndcynghk9m2k5annann)) #Highlight #[[2023-09-21]]
