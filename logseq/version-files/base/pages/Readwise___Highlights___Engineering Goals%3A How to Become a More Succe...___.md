- Predicting the year ahead is already hard enough, and it’s likely that you will switch gears throughout the year. Therefore, it’s not realistic to set yourself specific goals for a whole year. Instead, we defined Engineering Goals that are a little less specific. The Key Results, however, will be specific and should be scoped down to quarters at a minimum.
  
  By narrowing the scope to a shorter timespan, you’ll be able to predict your capabilities better. On top of that, you’ll revisit your Key Results every quarter, allowing you to stretch further and optimize targets. Note that I’m suggesting quarters here, but it’s also perfectly fine to set goals for a month ahead. The main point here is that you can predict your time better.
