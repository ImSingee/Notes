It took some time before I could say that TDD really works (for me). I don't think the problem was TDD, but my design and coding skills.

- The cycle at the heart of TDD is: write a test; write some code to get it working; refactor the code to be as simple an implementation of the tested features as possible. Repeat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyvzpd43qqsn3s20rn7zg0fg)) #Highlight #[[2024-05-27]]
- [Using TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llaUBH5oayw&list=PLwLLcwQlnXByqD3a13UPeT4SMhc3rdZ8q) should result in **significantly fewer production bugs** by having code that works as expected (in tests) and with **better design and higher quality of the code** (“easier to change”). The code should be **modular, loosely coupled, cohesive, separate concerns well**, and provide **good encapsulation**.
