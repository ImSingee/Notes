- üö® ASO tip for iOS apps: Your app's name and subtitle are the most important places for keywords. Most use them incorrectly and ruin their chances at getting downloads.
  
  I spent too much time reverse engineering the App Store's search algorithm and here are the top 5Ô∏è‚É£ things you have to know - do these right now to get more downloads.
  
  1Ô∏è‚É£ The name gets the most weight in terms of keywords. 
  If a keyword is in the name the algo will notice it, so use the most relevant/important keywords in your app's name.
  
  2Ô∏è‚É£ Weight is assigned from left to right, so use the most important keywords upfront. 
  Put your brand after your keywords unless your brand is super famous and people search the App Store for it. If they don't keywords are better.
  
  3Ô∏è‚É£ The subtitle is the second most important place for keywords. 
  Use it for all the other keywords you want to target. And because the algo reads keywords from the name and subtitle together, it will create combinations that cut across both.
  
  Here are the useful 2-word keywords the algorithm sees for Duolingo (in addition to its name):
  
  language lessons
  learn spanish
  learn french
  learn german
  spanish lessons
  french lessons
  german lessons
  
  Note: This name/subtitle combination isn't great because the keywords in the name aren't the most popular but the ones in the subtitle are. Even big companies can get it wrong...
  
  4Ô∏è‚É£ Duplication is evil and will hurt your ASO. 
  Don't repeat any keywords between the name, subtitle, or keyword list. 
  The reason for that is technical - the algorithm only sees the last instance of a word that's used multiple times, so if you use a word in the name and subtitle the algorithm will only see the one from the subtitle. And we already know the subtitle is less important than the name, so you end up losing value.
  
  5Ô∏è‚É£ Don't use all 30 characters of the name. 
  This might sound counterintuitive, but think of value as 100% split across all of the words in the name. More words = less weight per word. Fewer words = more weight per word. 
  It's a good strategy to use when targeting a competitive keyword.
  
  Bonus: I discovered a bug with the algorithm that hasn't been fixed yet. When you use certain characters, like & and some dashes, the algorithm counts them as two characters even though they're really only displayed as one. 
  If you use all 30 characters in the name _and_ one of those, the algorithm will see a name that's longer than 30 characters and ignore characters at the end, effectively chopping your last keyword.
  
  If you use those characters make sure to keep a safe margin and not use all 30.

  These are the basic rules for optimizing for the App Store. If you're doing these wrong right now, fixing them should give your app a serious boost.
