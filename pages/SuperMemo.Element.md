- Element 有四种类型
	- items 一个问答卡片
		- in the learning process they are supposed to provide a stimulus (e.g. a question) and you are supposed to respond to this stimulus (e.g. with the recall of a correct answer)
		- They often have a form of a question and an answer. They can also assume other forms. For example, multiple choice test, spelling exercise, picture recognition, etc
		- items 的图标为 L，背景色根据[状态]([[SuperMemo/Status]])不同可能是不同颜色
	- topics（代表一个文章）
		- pages of new information to learn
		- they do not provide a stimulus, do not require a response, and do not expect any feedback from you
		- article 和从 article 中切分出来的片段（Alt+X）都属于 topics
		- topic 的图标为 T
	- concepts
		- concepts represent an important idea or subject
		- 简单粗暴一点可以理解为文件夹？
		- 其被用于 [Neural Review]() 的过程
