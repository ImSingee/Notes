- While in insert mode, you can copy from the line above with <ctrl-y>. This will insert the character directly above the cursor. Or you can use <ctrl-e> to insert the character from the line below the cursor.
  
  <ctrl-y> – While in insert mode, copies the character from the line above.
  
  <ctrl-e> – While in insert mode, copies the character from the line below.
  And you can just hold down either one to copy continuously from the line above or below. #Highlight #[[2022-09-12]]
