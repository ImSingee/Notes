- One replication task will only transfer changes in one direction. To achieve master-master replication, it is possible to set up two replication tasks in opposite direction. When a change is replicated from database A to B by the first task, the second task from B to A will discover that the new change on B already exists in A and will wait for further changes.

- Using a selector provides performance benefits when compared with using a [Filter Functions](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/intro.html/../ddocs/ddocs.html#filterfun). You should use [Selector Objects](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/intro.html/replicator.html#selectorobj) where possible.

- When using replication filters that depend on the document’s content, deleted documents may pose a problem, since the document passed to the filter will not contain any of the document’s content. This can be resolved by adding a `_deleted:true` field to the document instead of using the DELETE HTTP method, paired with the use of a [validate document update](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/intro.html/../ddocs/ddocs.html#vdufun) handler to ensure the fields required for replication filters are always present. Take note, though, that the deleted document will still contain all of its data (including attachments)!
