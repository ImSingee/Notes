- A *Deployment* provides declarative updates for [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) and [ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).
  
  You describe a *desired state* in a Deployment, and the Deployment [Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
  
  **Note:** Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2d27y1m7dasmfaa3f5dwk5q)) #Highlight #[[2023-06-08]]
