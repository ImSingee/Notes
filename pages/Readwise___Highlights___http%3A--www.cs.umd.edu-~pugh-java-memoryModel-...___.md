- For example, if a thread writes to field
  a and then to field b, and the value of b
  does not depend on the value of a, then the compiler is free
  to reorder these operations, and the cache is free to flush b
  to main memory before a. There are a number of potential
  sources of reordering, such as the compiler, the JIT, and the
  cache. #Highlight #[[2022-05-26]]
- Volatile fields are special fields which are used for communicating state between threads. Each read of a volatile will see the last write to that volatile by any thread; in effect, they are designated by the programmer as fields for which it is never acceptable to see a "stale" value as a result of caching or reordering. #Highlight #[[2022-05-26]]
- Under the new memory model, it is still true that volatile variables cannot be reordered with each other. The difference is that it is now no longer so easy to reorder normal field accesses around them. Writing
  to a volatile field has the same memory effect as a monitor release,
  and reading from a volatile field has the same memory effect as a monitor
  acquire. In effect, because the new memory model places stricter
  constraints on reordering of volatile field accesses with other field
  accesses, volatile or not, anything that was visible to thread A when
  it writes to volatile field f becomes visible to thread B when it
  reads f. #Highlight #[[2022-05-26]]
- The most obvious reason is that the writes which initialize instance and the write to the instance field can be reordered by the compiler
  or the cache, which would have the effect of returning what appears to
  be a partially constructed Something. #Highlight #[[2022-05-26]]
