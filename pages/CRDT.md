		- Ideally, we'd like to have conflicts-free resolve, we tried both diff-match-patch and crdt, diff-match-patch doesn't work well because Logseq is an outliner, there're some cases that can result in broken outliner structures, crdt(text) has the same problem with diff-match-patch for breaking the outliner structures. crdt (list) might work, but it relies on something that's not yet available in Logseq (it requires each block has a persistent ID).
