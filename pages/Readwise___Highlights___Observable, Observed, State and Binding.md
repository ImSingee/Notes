- State and Binding work in pairs, inside SwiftUI views, in the form @State and @Binding.
  
  All SwiftUI views are structures, also known as structs. Once initialized, structs don't allow their internal variables to change. @State elements remove this restriction, allowing variables to be stored outside the structure itself in an area that can be changed. As a plus, they serve as control variables.
  
  @Binding, on the other hand, is used to create variables that receive values from @State variables and are connected to them in a way that any change to a @Binding variable will change the bind @State variable.
