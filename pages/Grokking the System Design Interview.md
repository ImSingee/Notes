- ## System Design Guide
	- ### System Design Interviews: A step by step guide
		- **Step 1: Requirements clarifications**
			- It is always a good idea to ask questions about the exact scope of the problem we are trying to solve. Candidates who spend enough time to define the end goals of the system always have a better chance to be successful in the interview.
		- **Step 2: Back-of-the-envelope estimation**
			- It is always a good idea to estimate the scale of the system we’re going to design. This will also help later when we focus on scaling, partitioning, load balancing, and caching.
			- scale, storage, network bandwidth
		- **Step 3: System interface definition**
			- Define what APIs are expected from the system. This will establish the exact contract expected from the system and ensure if we haven’t gotten any requirements wrong.
		- **Step 4: Defining data model**
			- Defining the data model in the early part of the interview will clarify how data will flow between different system components.
			- Later, it will guide for data partitioning and management.
				- storage, transportation, encryption
		- **Step 5: High-level design**
			- Draw a block diagram with **5-6 boxes** representing the core components of our system. We should identify enough components that are needed to solve the actual problem from end to end.
		- **Step 6: Detailed design**
			- Dig deeper into two or three major components; the interviewer’s feedback should always guide us to what parts of the system need further discussion.
			- We should present different approaches, their pros and cons, and explain why we will prefer one approach over the other.
				- Remember, there is no single answer; the only important thing is to consider tradeoffs between different options while keeping system constraints in mind.
