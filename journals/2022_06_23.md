- 数据库的 Join、Pandas 的 merge
	- LEFT JOIN 保留且仅保留左侧的键
	- RIGHT JOIN 保留且仅保留右侧的键
		- RIGHT JOIN works analogously to LEFT JOIN. To keep code portable across databases, it is recommended that you use LEFT JOIN instead of RIGHT JOIN.
	- OUTER JOIN 合并左右侧的键都保留
	- INNER JOIN 仅保留左右侧都有的键
		- In MySQL, `JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, and `INNER JOIN` are syntactic equivalents (they can replace each other). In standard SQL, they are not equivalent. INNER JOIN is used with an ON clause, CROSS JOIN is used otherwise.
		- `STRAIGHT_JOIN` is similar to `JOIN`, except that the left table is always read before the right table. This can be used for those (few) cases for which the join optimizer processes the tables in a suboptimal order.
