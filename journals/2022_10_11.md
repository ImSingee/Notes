	- **What are Pronouns (or “Gender Pronouns” / “Preferred Gender Pronouns”)?**
		- Pronouns are used in language all the time when we refer to ourselves or other people. Examples of pronouns you might use refer to others are:
		   - *he/him/his* (for someone who might identify as male),
		   - *she/her/hers* (for someone who might identify as female),
		   - *they/them/their* (for someone who might not identify strictly as male or female, these pronouns are considered ‘gender neutral’; also used when referring to multiple people).
	- **If someone feels the need to state their pronouns, does it mean they are transgender and/or gender non-conforming?**
		- Not at all. *Everyone* has a gender identity, and most of us have specific pronouns we’d like people to use when we are being referred to. Some might ask: Isn’t it typically obvious what pronouns to use for a person? (For instance, if someone has a ‘female’ name and looks ‘female,’ then can’t one assume that person identifies as female and would want to be referred to with she/her/hers pronouns?) To answer that question, yes, most of us are privileged in that when someone guesses our pronouns, they’ll get them right. However, that’s not the case for everyone. Oftentimes this might be because a person is gender non-conforming (where they don’t clearly conform to ‘traditional’ male or female standards) or are openly transgender (which might also leave some unsure which pronouns to use). With that said, if someone decides to tell you their pronouns, it does not automatically mean they are transgender or gender non-conforming. It’s basically a way of saying “rather than operating in a system where we assume each other’s gender and automatically attach pronouns to each other, I’ll instead let you know what pronouns work best for me.” Isn’t life easier when we’re not always having to assume things about each other?
