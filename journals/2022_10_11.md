	- **What are Pronouns (or “Gender Pronouns” / “Preferred Gender Pronouns”)?**
		- Pronouns are used in language all the time when we refer to ourselves or other people. Examples of pronouns you might use refer to others are:
		   - *he/him/his* (for someone who might identify as male),
		   - *she/her/hers* (for someone who might identify as female),
		   - *they/them/their* (for someone who might not identify strictly as male or female, these pronouns are considered ‘gender neutral’; also used when referring to multiple people).
	- **If someone feels the need to state their pronouns, does it mean they are transgender and/or gender non-conforming?**
