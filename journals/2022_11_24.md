- [How does Windows decide whether your computer has limited or full Internet access?](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20221115-00/?p=107399)
	- Windows attempts to download a file from a dedicated Web server. Depending on which version of Windows, it's  `http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt`  or  `http://www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt` .
	- If the download is successful and contains the correct contents, then Windows concludes that you have full Internet access. If something goes wrong, Windows will report either limited or no Internet access, depending on what exactly went wrong.
